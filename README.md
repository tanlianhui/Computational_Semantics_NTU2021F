Codes used in Computational Semantics offered by Prof. Shu-Kai Hsieh. 
Special thanks to TA Yu-Yun (Derek) Liao for providing preliminary code examples.

This project uses fastText (Bojanowski et al., 2017; Joulin et al., 2016a, 2016b) to represent word vectors of slots in the Mandarin Chinese construction *jia X zhen Y*.

Data sentences of the construction is collected from Chinese Word Sketch Engine (Huang et al., 2005), and is cleaned manually as "data sentences.xlsx".

The results have shown that there are patterns exist in the slots of *jia X zhen Y* constrution. However, more research is needed to see if the pattern persists in other data sentence sources.
